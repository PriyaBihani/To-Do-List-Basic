It is just another one of my amateur projects, when i just completed learning Javascript Dom.

It is a basic to do list with add and delete operations from the list.
You can see your pending list and completed list. 
You also have the functionality to delete from the completed list. 
It has an engaging color Scheme with check boxes and complet UI with status bar to increase the user experience exponentionally.

It uses basic front-end technologies HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

## Try it

#### 2) Open in any Code Editor preferably VS code and run with live server.
